## TODO
- Add the data @dstimkin
- Preprocess data @abhaydmathur @Priscille-Erulin @dstimkin
- Normalise the 3 EPIs @dstimkin
- Make country selection on globe @abhaydmathur
- Country roll down + add it above @abhaydmathur
- Figure out the layout ( 4 sections ) @dstimkin
- Import the 3 icons on favicon @abhaydmathur
- Create buttons for continent @abhaydmathur
- Create buttons for scenarios @Priscille-Erulin
- Finish map @abhaydmathur

### Globe.js

1. Fix transitions btw nations
2. Improve Search bar
3. Get someone who isn't colour blind to decide colour schemes.

### Crop production and climate scenarios
The aim of this visualization is to put into perspective global emissions with an example of socio-economic impact: crop production, directly correlated to life prices and purchasing power in different countries.

This visualization presents the predicted productions of wheat, rice and maize under 7 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), that describe 7 plausible futures with different emission trajectories. These scenarios have been designed by considering different socio-economic and technological developments. Some of these are: 
- various speeds of carbon removal technologies devellopments
- evolutions in the global energy mix
- the speed of population and economic growth
- the attention given to sustainable and social issues
impacting the evolution of emissions over the 21st century and thus crop production.

The 7 scenarios presented here are:
- AF1: "All fossil fuels" scenario. It considers a world with rapid economic and population growth, peaking mid-century and decreasing after; the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies; and a fossil fuel-intensive energy mix.
- A2a: This scenario considers a nationally or regionally oriented development, leading to fragmented economic and technological growth as well as a steadily growing population.
- A2b: Similar to A2a but considering a more rapid technological development leading to a less carbon-emitting scenario
- A2c: Similar to A2a and A2b, but with greater emphasis on social sustainability.
- B1a: Considers the same population evolution as scenario A1 but a rapid economic evolution towards service and information; the development of clean technologies; and an emphasis on social sustainability
- B2a: A scenario focused on local solutions, an intermediate levels of development, less rapid and more diverse technological development than previous scenarios, as well as a balanced energy mix.
- B2b: Similar to B2a, but with more emphasis on social and economic sustainability.
